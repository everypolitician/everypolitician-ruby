# Everypolitician [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/everypolitician/everypolitician-ruby.svg?branch=v0.1.0)](https://travis-ci.org/everypolitician/everypolitician-ruby) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/everypolitician.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/everypolitician)

Interface with [EveryPolitician](http://everypolitician.org) data from your Ruby application.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'everypolitician'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install everypolitician

## Usage

Pass the `:slug` of the country to the `country` method, and the `:slug` of the legislature to the `legislature` method.

Examples:

```ruby
require 'everypolitician'

australia = Everypolitician::Index.new.country('Australia')
australia.code # => "AU"
senate = australia.legislature('Senate')
senate.popolo # => #<Everypolitician::Popolo::JSON>

united_kingdom = Everypolitician::Index.new.country('UK')
house_of_commons = united_kingdom.legislature('Commons')

american_samoa = Everypolitician::Index.new.country('American-Samoa')
house_of_representatives = american_samoa.legislature('House')

united_arab_emirates = Everypolitician::Index.new.country('United-Arab-Emirates')
national_council = united_arab_emirates.legislature('Federal-National-Council')

algeria = Everypolitician::Index.new.country('Algeria')
national_assembly = algeria.legislature('Majlis')

# Iterate though all known countries
Everypolitician::Index.new.countries do |country|
  puts "#{country.name} has #{country.legislatures.size} legislature(s)"
end
```

By default, the gem connects to EveryPolitician's data on GitHub over HTTPS and
returns the most recent data. Specifically it uses the current index file,
called `countries.json`, which itself contains links to specific versions of
data files.

If you want to point at a different `countries.json`, you can override this default behavour by supplying an
`index_url` option to `Everypolitician::Index.new` like this:

```ruby
Everypolitician::Index.new(index_url: 'https://cdn.rawgit.com/everypolitician/everypolitician-data/080cb46/countries.json')
```

The example above is using a specific commit (indicated by the hash `080cb46`).

For more about `countries.json`, see [this description](http://docs.everypolitician.org/repo_structure.html).

Remember that EveryPolitician data is frequently updated â€” see this information
about [using EveryPolitician data](http://docs.everypolitician.org/use_the_data.html).
